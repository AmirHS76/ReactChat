This is a project using asp.net as back-end and react as front-end
The main focus of project is around chat and new technologies and architectures like HangFire, UnitOfWork, Clean architecture etc..
I will try to update and add more technologies every week
It is a good start up project for new junior developers that want to try Asp.Net Core and react
the main concept of project is to show messages to clients with SignalR and save messages to database using Ef Core with Background services (HangFire)


For running run back-end project first or with front-end using vite

you can also run projects in docker with existing configuration
